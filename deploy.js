//to run this js file run ==> node deploy.js(deploy is a file name)
//like remix first we need to compile our contracts so we need to install solc package ==> solidity compiler
//to install this package we need  to install them using npm ==> node package manager
//also we can use other package managers as well , like yarn package manager
// to install yarn run ==> corepack enable
//yarn will be enabled then, now, install solc using yarn run ==> yarn add solc
//this would add some of the files to our system like - package.json which tells us about the dependencies we are using in this current project
// node modules folder will have all the packages that are being installed in our project
